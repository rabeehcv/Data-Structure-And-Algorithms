Algorithm - Method for solving the problem.

Data Structure - Method to store the information.

### Java Class

In Java, a class is a template that defines the structure and behavior (data and methods) of objects. A class encapsulates data for the object and methods to manipulate that data. A class is defined only once and serves as a reference for creating multiple objects.

An object is an instance of a class. We can create many objects from a single class.

#### Structure of a Java Class

Declaration: A class is declared using the class keyword followed by the class name.

Fields (Variables): These are attributes or properties that store the state of the object.

Methods: These are functions or procedures that define the behavior of the object.

Constructors: Special methods that are called when an object is instantiated. They initialize the object's state.

```
public class Car {
    // Fields
    private String color;
    private String model;
    private int year;

    // Constructor
    public Car(String color, String model, int year) {
        this.color = color;
        this.model = model;
        this.year = year;
    }

    // Methods
    public String getColor() {
        return color;
    }

    public void setColor(String color) {
        this.color = color;
    }

    public String getModel() {
        return model;
    }

    public void setModel(String model) {
        this.model = model;
    }

    public int getYear() {
        return year;
    }

    public void setYear(int year) {
        this.year = year;
    }

    public void displayInfo() {
        System.out.println("Car Model: " + model + ", Year: " + year + ", Color: " + color);
    }
}
```

In the statement

```
this.color = color;
```

'this' is used to refer to the instance variable 'color' of the current object.

##### Explanation

color: This is the parameter passed to the constructor or method.

this.color: This refers to the instance variable color of the object on which the constructor or method is being invoked.

### Java Archive File (JAR)

A Java Archive (JAR) file is a package file format used to aggregate many Java class files, metadata, and resources (such as text, images, etc.) into one file for distribution. JAR files are built on the ZIP file format and have a .jar file extension. JAR files simplify the distribution of Java applications and libraries. Instead of distributing many individual files, you can distribute just one JAR file.

You can create a JAR file using the jar tool that comes with the Java Development Kit (JDK). Hereâ€™s a simple example:

1. Compile Your Java Classes:

```
javac *.java
```

2. Create the JAR File:

```
jar cf myapp.jar *.class
```

c - Create a new archive.

f - Specify the archive file name.

3. Create an Executable JAR:

If you want to create an executable JAR file, you need to specify the main class in the manifest file.

Create a manifest file manifest.txt:

```
Main-Class: MyMainClass
```

Then, create the JAR file with the manifest:

```
jar cfm myapp.jar manifest.txt *.class
```

To use a JAR file in your Java project, you include it in your classpath. For example, if you have a JAR file named library.jar, you can compile and run your program like this:

```
javac -cp .:library.jar MyProgram.java
java -cp .:library.jar MyProgram
```
